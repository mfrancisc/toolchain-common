// AssertThat is a helper function that tests that the provided object satisfies given predicate.
// It is a exactly implemented as:
//
//	assert.True(t, predicate.Matches(object))
//
// but provides better readability. Instead of:
//
//	assert.True(t, Is(Named("asdf")).Matches(object))
//
// one can write:
//
//	AssertThat(t, object, Is(Named("asdf")))
//
// Note that it intentionally doesn't accept a slice of predicates so that it is easy
// to spot the failed predicate in the actual tests and the caller doesn't have to guess
// which of the many supplied predicates might have failed.
